## Age of Entanglement
Neri Oxman raises some very good points with their hypothesis that art, design, engineering and science can all be related to each other. I like this style of abstract yet sensical thinking. My brain very much looks at things from an art and design perspective and with this 'out of the box' style thinking sometimes my solutions are a little abstract, but they do propose a good solution to the matter at hand. The writing is definitly a higher level of thinking and my brain hurtafter reading it all. But it was a good read and got me thinking about the Krebs cycle of creativity and how the 4 'pillars' ultimatly flow to one another.
