## Machine Learning and AI in Photomanipulation

The proposed idea I have for my project is taking an image and through AI and Machine Learning **ML** creating sometyhing that is a little more appealing to the eye, basic adjustments to the overall tone of the image can really make all the difference compared to a shot that is straight out of the camera. As a photographer the amount of time I spend editing images to just the basic level can take quite a while, especially if there are thousands to go through. Photomanipulation software can do it all for you but sometimes isn't the result you want plus the software (like adobe) can be costly. Therefore I want to try my hand at something along these lines. I will most likely fail but hopefully in a spectacular manner that may create an abstract piece, or succeed in which case hooray. Either basic adjustments or total abtractedness is a win in my eyes!

This is particularly interesting to me as it the researchers and developers of this encoder model have used existing landscapes and terxtures to totally change the original images feel both in texture but also by adding extra details like bushes or snow etc. There is a large paper attached to the website which has them face the challenge of creating controlled manipulation on existing images. My understanding from this would be that most AI or ML photomanipulation is somewhat uncontrollable and you get what you're given

Existing software of something I would like to try, be funky uses AI to enhance the image you present it and along with that is constantly learning so it can provide even better results in the future. A simple enhancer could be something I may be able to manage, playing with basic exposure and contrast etc. to get the image looking better than it does from the camera, improve the tones and make editing easier for someone who doesn't have the time to spend hours doing it.

Robert Gonsalves created a way for Generative Adversial Network GAN to create abstract pieces of art. He gathered abstract images from wiki art that were all public domain and from there trained his GAN to random images. He mentioned he had about 850 images and that that was not really enough to properly train it. I have thousands of images but it took him 3 weeks for it to be trained whereas for time I don't think I'm going to have that long to create.
