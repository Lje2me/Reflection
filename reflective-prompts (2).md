I have heard of it before, it is a useful way to manage time, I will use it during development of my programme to ensure I am staying on top of things
### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
About a 3 on my repository, I hope I have created it the way I was supposed to. I am less confident in the final as I have no idea if my project will work or how it is going to look if it fails, not sure how to show it in a exhibition
### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
I am proud of the coding activities, remembering the basics was a good booster for me but it seemed short lived the moment I considered my final project
### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 
I find I work best when shown something a couple of times and then have time to practice myself, it worked well in L4 and has carried over somewhat into L5 youtube helps where I can follow along and slowly get an understanding of what does what and why. reading articles with code examples somewhat help but most seem to assume you are already a god at programming

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
Be prepared for AI to blow your little mind
### What is Python?
Python is a programming language that can be used to create almost anything, it is rather easy to learn and has lots and lots of features and libraries to make it even better
### Have you developed a habit of exploring?
I feel as though I have, almost like diving down the rabbit hole and just getting lost in all the new information that is presented to me, I enjoy it but it can also be a bito f anightmare when I find myself in deep uncharted water without first dipping my toes in the subject
### Have you meditated before?
I have practised meditation a couple of times to regain and centre myself when things get a little crazy in life
### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
Hockey, photography and some video games. The Hockey and photography took years of hard work and research to get to where I was. There was a time not long ago had 6 days a week of hockey alone! My degree time really helped develop my photography and my way of seeing things. Lots of late nights of research and developing photos. Video games I seem to become good at purely just from countless hours of trial and error and planning ahead for what could be the next challenge or what my opponent is going to do next.
### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
Very very basic developer of super simple things otherwise not really I see a developer as someone who has a much better understanding 
### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
Yes I value creativity, as a creative it is my main way of looking at things, I think it is an excellent tool for logical thinking as it allows you to take different approaches and to think about not only the bigger picture but also looking in depth
### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
Cuursntly I have 7 on one monitor and 2 on the other, All of them are to do with Study, I do glance at TikTok on the odd occaision on my phone which is to my right
### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
I for the longest time had a fight response to apple tech, I was an android user from 2010 and was sternly against ever getting apple products, android offers much more customization of the homescreen etc, All my friends were slowly getting more and more apple orientated, I refused to make the change. It wasn't until 2020 while in lock down that my soon to be wife kept telling me how much easier it would be if we both had an iPhone. So after 10 years I reluctently made the switch, certain lack of features or ways of doing things at first frustrated me but I have learnt to overcome that and now I dont mind the Apple eco system. Still cant believe adding photos from a PC is still incredibly difficult but thank google for google drive.

An IDE is an application in which you can write in a programming language and it will be able to interpret and perform the code, PyCharm for example is an IDE or VScode

yes, to overcome I talked with my team and thankfully we could come to some way to overcome, we also had a large group discussion before breaking off into teams which helped get rid of any initial uncertainties

OOP or object orientated programming uses objects to define data like a class, python usues OOP
