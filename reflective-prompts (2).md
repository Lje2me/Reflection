### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
Every hour or so I took a 10 minute break to walk around and stretch, also to clear my mind and ease my worries
### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
I have heard of it before, it is a useful way to manage time, I will use it during development of my programme to ensure I am staying on top of things
### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
About a 3 on my repository, I hope I have created it the way I was supposed to. I am less confident in the final as I have no idea if my project will work or how it is going to look if it fails, not sure how to show it in a exhibition
### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
I am proud of the coding activities, remembering the basics was a good booster for me but it seemed short lived the moment I considered my final project
### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 
I find I work best when shown something a couple of times and then have time to practice myself, it worked well in L4 and has carried over somewhat into L5 youtube helps where I can follow along and slowly get an understanding of what does what and why. reading articles with code examples somewhat help but most seem to assume you are already a god at programming

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
Be prepared for AI to blow your little mind
### What is Python?
Python is a programming language that can be used to create almost anything, it is rather easy to learn and has lots and lots of features and libraries to make it even better
### Have you developed a habit of exploring?
I feel as though I have, almost like diving down the rabbit hole and just getting lost in all the new information that is presented to me, I enjoy it but it can also be a bito f anightmare when I find myself in deep uncharted water without first dipping my toes in the subject
### Have you meditated before?
I have practised meditation a couple of times to regain and centre myself when things get a little crazy in life
### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
Hockey, photography and some video games. The Hockey and photography took years of hard work and research to get to where I was. There was a time not long ago had 6 days a week of hockey alone! My degree time really helped develop my photography and my way of seeing things. Lots of late nights of research and developing photos. Video games I seem to become good at purely just from countless hours of trial and error and planning ahead for what could be the next challenge or what my opponent is going to do next.
### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
Very very basic developer of super simple things otherwise not really I see a developer as someone who has a much better understanding 
### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
Yes I value creativity, as a creative it is my main way of looking at things, I think it is an excellent tool for logical thinking as it allows you to take different approaches and to think about not only the bigger picture but also looking in depth
### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
Cuursntly I have 7 on one monitor and 2 on the other, All of them are to do with Study, I do glance at TikTok on the odd occaision on my phone which is to my right
### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
I for the longest time had a fight response to apple tech, I was an android user from 2010 and was sternly against ever getting apple products, android offers much more customization of the homescreen etc, All my friends were slowly getting more and more apple orientated, I refused to make the change. It wasn't until 2020 while in lock down that my soon to be wife kept telling me how much easier it would be if we both had an iPhone. So after 10 years I reluctently made the switch, certain lack of features or ways of doing things at first frustrated me but I have learnt to overcome that and now I dont mind the Apple eco system. Still cant believe adding photos from a PC is still incredibly difficult but thank google for google drive.
### What is an IDE?
An IDE is an application in which you can write in a programming language and it will be able to interpret and perform the code, PyCharm for example is an IDE or VScode
### What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge?
1. Mashmallow dust goes EVERYWHERE!
2. prototyping, creating a working structure and from there working to refine or even redesign
### Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?
yes, to overcome I talked with my team and thankfully we could come to some way to overcome, we also had a large group discussion before breaking off into teams which helped get rid of any initial uncertainties
### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
figuring out what I want to do as my project is definitly the hardest, I have lots of ideas but trying to think of how I can actually achieve one of those ideas is a struggle
### What is OOP?
OOP or object orientated programming uses objects to define data like a class, python usues OOP
### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?
I have used some of it to further develop my understanding, most other times I have used w3 schools as they are quite a good online source where you can practise immediatly. 
### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
I will admit, Github is not my most favorite thing ever, stylising and everything else is kind of lost on me. It's not a terrible experience and maybe if I had a better workflow it wouldnt seem so tedious
### What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism in programming is the concept that different objects can be accessed by one interface, it is the idea that there is more than one way to achieve the desired outcome.
### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
Yes, from Level 4 I thought I had a good understanding of programming, however the different concepts and ways of thinking somewhat confused me. I have been critical about my non existent program already thinking it's not going to be very good or work at all, I somewhat believe this as I have gone from creating a calculator using Tkinter to now considering AI which seems like a bigger jump in skill that not even Evel himself could clear
### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
Coming from a sporting background I still first up think of Most valuable player. However now I know it means something else too! Minimum Viable product is something that has barebones features that just works enough for people to provide feedback. To explain to a child I would do the following: "it's a cake with no icing but you can tell the person to add frosting, sprinkles whatever you think will imrove the cake so more people will like it"
### What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?
In life or in this course? In life it would be the internal struggle I have had since I left high school 'what am I going to do now' Finally after a failed attempt at doing engineering, gaining a degree in art and design I now know that I want to be part of the everchanging IT industry. For this course however it was probably one of the tasks we did in week 3, I don't recall it but I found ut difficult and so to accomplish and overcome it I felt great!
### What is pair programming?
Pair Programming is an Agile technique. 2 programmers use 1 computer to design and test code. The classic two heads are better than one method which is really interesting to me. Do they take turns typing or does someone self nominate themselves as typer/lead while the other sits there and just suggests along the way. Much like helping dad in the garage as a child, sitting there until he asked me to hand him the 10mm socket. 
### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?
The endless creative possibilities to solve many problems. 
### What is conscious listening?
being present while someone is talking, being aware of not only the content of the words they are speaking but also their emotions.
### What is a variable?
A variable is something that is not defined from the get go but can take a user input as its value. for example 'x' can be a variable and if I were to give x the value of 5. x would equal 5. meaning that now 2x would be 10. It keeps the given value until a new value is given/program restarted
### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?
I interested in furthering python as it seems like the most versatile programming language other than that I am not super into any other language for the time being since I'm not 100% on the advantages and disadvantages of each language.
### What is something kind that someone has done for you?
There are either too many or none that come to mind! Having a blank here, I would say the countless times I've had free accomodation in Queenstown due to the kindness of my friends family
### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?
its the foundation of everything on the computer, its a lot of typing and jargon but when it works oh boy is it great!
### Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?
Github, no question made me doubt a lot, it has so many features and hidden things you can do with it. Most of the concepts I understand to some degree, The free choice of a final project also had me doubting my abiltiy as I kept jumping to the most complicated outcome
### What is a fixed mindset?
It is the mindset in which there is only one way to do things, it also would suggest that skill is the key to success and throws out the concept of the abstract and creative. I would think the other name for it is a onetrack mind, only ever thinking with no lateral movement at all. 
### What is something kind you have done for someone else?
A couple of things come to mind, Offered 2 hitchhikers a ride into wanaka from a campsite out of town. They were lovely people and didn't murder me so that was a plus. Another thing would be the countless times I have jumpstarted someone when their car has been stranded. It fills me with accomplishment when I help someone else out so I do my best to often help whatever the issue may be, even if it turns out I'm of no help!
### Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?
I can't say that I have, I can focus pretty well, I have the odd 30 second break to look at my phone very briefly but so long as I achieve what I set out to do I am happy
### Have you developed a habit of persevering?
Yes, big time. I would say it is one of my strongest feats. I think because I'm partially stubborn I want something to work so I will continue to work at it until it is doing as I expect. I work on cars a lot in my spare time, mainly my own car I drive on the daily so when I come across a problem that has arisen I work hard to get it done before the next day since I always need to drive places. Great example is a few months ago I put a short shift in my car, the task to remove the original took a little but of time but was relativly straightforward, when it cam to installing the new part however, the internal diameter was a little too small so it didn't slide onto the mount, after some choice words I considered just putting the old shifter back in, it was then I took some time to think and came to the conclusion that I could make the internal diameter bigger with some filing, 30 mins later the part slid on a treat and I completed the install. All the while 2 of my family members were telling me I should have just left it and that they knew it wasnt going to work. Great feeling proving someone wrong as well as seeing all my efforts not be for nothing!
