# Reflective Journal

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programmer developed from MIT, it uses set blocks to create games and other scenarios
### What is visual programming?
visual programming uses a graphical interface where users can see what they are creating a little easier than text based programming 
### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
I like the classic Keep it simple stupid (KISS) it's great for reminding me that there is no need to overdo or overthink a task or line of code.
### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
I created a baseball game that uses object sensing that leads to certain events if the ball is missed or hit, I found it to be an enjoyable experience to create, scratch is great at allowing you to see almost instantly what your changes do and not having to type out line after line was also pretty nice.

## Week 2:

### What is git?
Git is a  software that tracks changes done by any given person in a team in any kind of file. it is commonly used by programmers to create and develop code
### What is GitHub?
GitHub is an online tool that easily allows people to colaborate on code etc and keeps track of all changes commited by each user. it has a large community where people share their ideas and allows others to fork off a persons branch to create something new or further develop that source code.

## Week 3:

### code Activities
The coding activities were a little challenging to begin with while I rest my brain back to python after the holiday between level 4 and 5. Once I had a little helpful nudge from a fellow class member I was off and racing! Most of the code worked as expected aside from the odd failure here and there due to syntax. But for the most part I felt confident in my ability. It sometimes just takes me a little longer to think things through but once I get it I seem to manage to get it done rather quickly.

## Week 4:
### Video Graph
1. I felt comfortable as the subject of a video, for my art and design degree I was subject to many cameras so became accustomed very quickly.
2. I did not really notice my own ego but what was shown to me opened my eyes on how people might view me, I was also a little self concious with a little double chin showing so my own self image came into question, so after the fact yes I suppose my ego came into it.
3. We are always evolving with phones, there is a meme somewhere (i'll try to find it) with the evolution of humans standing tall, but as the phone comes in we see the head and neck droop more and more 
4. To draw the activity I suppose start drawing a subject in as much or as little detail and once they move or get up from their space, stop drawing?
5. I felt more attachment to my image, seeing how others see me rather than my device, I do tend to spend a lot of time on my phone but when in the presence of others I try to be more present and so the phone takes a back seat.

Roman brought up a good point of AI making things more accesible for people in coding, similar to how the medium of photography made art more accessible for people and how much depth you can now dive in with the introduction of photo manipulation. This made me think about AI and manipulation working together to further enhance an image or create a totally new abstract one with similar subjects from the original. This could make for an interesting project all beit well out of my skillset.

## Week 5
### Agile development
Today was all about Agile and the process of that. I quite like the idea of it, if you are stuck you don't get left to deal with it on your own. in a community based/team based set up people work with you to solve your ' block' 
Thursdays session we created towers with marshmallows and spaghetti with rope and tape within 18 mins and then 7mins. I thought this was a similar experiment to artists who spend an hour drawing an amazing detailed picture and then recreating it in increasingly less time and the images clearly getting worse and worse. For my team though we spent a bit of time in the 18min block planning and then creating, for the shorter blocks we teneded to follow the same kind of idea with  a few tweaks from what we learnt the previous time. This relates to prototyping from my understanding of what we were tryting to achieve.
