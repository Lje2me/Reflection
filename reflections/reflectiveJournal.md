## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programmer developed from MIT, it uses set blocks to create games and other scenarios
### What is visual programming?
visual programming uses a graphical interface where users can see what they are creating a little easier than text based programming 
### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
I like the classic Keep it simple stupid (KISS) it's great for reminding me that there is no need to overdo or overthink a task or line of code.
### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
I created a baseball game that uses object sensing that leads to certain events if the ball is missed or hit, I found it to be an enjoyable experience to create, scratch is great at allowing you to see almost instantly what your changes do and not having to type out line after line was also pretty nice.
