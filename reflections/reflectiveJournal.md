# Reflective Journal

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programmer developed from MIT, it uses set blocks to create games and other scenarios
### What is visual programming?
visual programming uses a graphical interface where users can see what they are creating a little easier than text based programming 
### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
I like the classic Keep it simple stupid (KISS) it's great for reminding me that there is no need to overdo or overthink a task or line of code.
### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
I created a baseball game that uses object sensing that leads to certain events if the ball is missed or hit, I found it to be an enjoyable experience to create, scratch is great at allowing you to see almost instantly what your changes do and not having to type out line after line was also pretty nice.

## Week 2:

### What is git?
Git is a  software that tracks changes done by any given person in a team in any kind of file. it is commonly used by programmers to create and develop code
### What is GitHub?
GitHub is an online tool that easily allows people to colaborate on code etc and keeps track of all changes commited by each user. it has a large community where people share their ideas and allows others to fork off a persons branch to create something new or further develop that source code.

## Week 3:

### code Activities
The coding activities were a little challenging to begin with while I rest my brain back to python after the holiday between level 4 and 5. Once I had a little helpful nudge from a fellow class member I was off and racing! Most of the code worked as expected aside from the odd failure here and there due to syntax. But for the most part I felt confident in my ability. It sometimes just takes me a little longer to think things through but once I get it I seem to manage to get it done rather quickly.
